this dir contain bashfunction / alias pack and other modification who could be set into the .bashrc file
but if you put them here instead of directly into bashrc, it will be cleaner and easy to enable/disable fonctionalities

regarding alias, it could be a best practive to use the modular alias system instead of this folder if your objective is to enable some alias only if some command exist

only file with .sh extension will be imported
